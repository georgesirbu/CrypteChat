CrypteChat is built using GTK# framework. It provides AES-256 end-to-end encryption to ensure that messages cannot be intercepted
by a third party. This is best used for groups on the same LAN network who need a quick, easy, and secure way to communicate.

Currently this project is a work-in-progress, but should ready for 1.0 soon.
